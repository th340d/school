# Summary

While the whitepaper contains an Abstract, its language remains quite technical, so I will also provide a quick and more accessible summary of its contents here.

Firstly, diagrams get exponentially harder to read as more detail is added to them. This means that they are good for uses where not a lot of detail is required.

Secondly, the times when not a lot of detail are required are when one is taking a super-broad and a super-specific perspective, and most of all when representing one's own data (because then one doesn't need to include a lot of context).

Thirdly, everything that can be expressed as a diagram can be expressed as a list and vice versa. To begin with, it is less important what tool we use than it is to determine how we can actually represent the process of turning ideas into discrete, executable tasks cleanly, in terms of homogenous data that can be entered into a database.

Fourthly, the way that we achieve this is by turning our definition of what an "idea" is into four discrete stages, each of which increases in its level of sophistication and may be represented by one of the four forms of end-of-sentence punctuation.

These four stages are, as follows:

1) Names (uses exclamation points): "Doughnut!"

2) Directives (uses ellipses): "EAT DOUGHNUT..."

3) Questions (uses question marks): "How do I fulfil my desire to eat this doughnut?"

4) Commands (uses periods): "Bite into the doughnut."

Fifthly, armed with these four stages, there are two types of diagrams we can use together to represent them, named "Directive Trees" (for stages 1 and 2) and "DQC Diagrams" (for stages 3 and 4) respectively.

Sixthly, as diagrams are the most useful for people representing data that they are personally related to, we find these diagrams are best used to allow people to manage their own tasks (either that they have proposed, are funding or are involved in executing). Other than extremely broad bird's eye analyses of the collective data that is subsequently generated, everything else in the system is tied together and can be handled using various forms of lists.

Seventhly, the "lists" that are used in particular are autocompletion and SERPs. In other words, gigantic diagrams aren't very useful, so instead we give users diagrams to input and manage their data, and then standard search engine tools to look through all of the public data that gets collected together.

Eighthly, there are still some interesting things we can use the public data for to assist people in managing their own personal data, such as making recommendations based on similarity to other user inputs.

Ninthly, the entire notion of using diagrams to manage crowd capital allocation is exceedingly valuable and similar technology can eventually be expanded to form the basis of entirely decentralized search recommendations.

Tenthly, for more information on any of these points, naturally, refer to the whitepaper.
