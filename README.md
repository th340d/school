# School

This repository contains School, David Hopkins' submission to the Mapsmap challenge, and will be composed of three parts:

1. A whitepaper which discusses the questions posed by the Mapsmap challenge in depth, then proceeds to propose a comprehensive technical solution.

2. A simple, introductory implementation of a solution such as described by the whitepaper in the form of a mobile app, which includes a walkthrough.

3. Supplementary materials that will be referred to in the course of the walkthrough.

It is recommended that one goes through the submission in the order provided above, starting with the whitepaper.

## Dedication

Special thanks to the organisers of the Mapsmap challenge for proposing the initial idea for School and facilitating the competition that inspired its development.
